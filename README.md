# Shoot for the Stars
## An analysis of return on investment in the film industry based on genre, lead actor, and director. 

### The analysis we conducted of the film industry was derived using data from IMDB. This included a large list of movies as well as plenty of information about each movie - such as who directed the movie, who starred in it, what it was rated, and more.  

### The first point of interest we approached this data set with was ROI (return on investment). As this is a finance class, we focused on the financial aspect of the film industry. We were curious to see if movies that have large gross profits also have a large return on investment. Were they making a lot in the box office, but way over budgeting for big name stars? Was it worth the investment? Do certain genres tend to have a greater return? These are some of the questions we aimed to uncover.
### Below is a summary answer to each question we asked, as well as a plot to help visualize our findings.
